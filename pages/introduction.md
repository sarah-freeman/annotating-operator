<h1>The Project</h1>

<p>
This project consists of annotations of three recordings of Oana Avasilichioaei’s performance at the 2019 SpokenWeb Symposium. These recordings were captured by three recording devices placed differently in the space, and each has a distinct sound. This project explores how annotation can highlight the individuality of each audiotext, and the lack of an absolute meaning or quality linking distinct audiotexts. I critically consider the practice of digital audio annotation as an artifact of my own listening experience, which is necessarily specific to the mediations of space, technology, and social influence. In this introduction, I explore how annotation can assert the non-singularity of recorded audio by attending to the specificities of the moment of performance, its multimodal mediation, and the significance of the listening experience. Because this is a case study in specificity, I place my discussion in the context of Avasilichioaei’s performance of Operator, which itself is a commentary on the sound of surveillance and the practice of audio transcription.
